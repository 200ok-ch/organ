* General

All user visible changes to organice will be documented in this file.

When there are updates to the changelog, you will be notified and see a 'gift' icon appear on the top right corner.


* [2020-01-20 Mon]

** Fixed
   - When refiling a header, don't show subheaders in the refile drawer
   - In the agenda view, fix relative time distance for future dates
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/240][PR]] üôè

* [2020-01-15 Wed]

** Fixed
   - Put Floating Action Button "Move a header" into the middle of the
     screen, so that it has enough space to render all arrows on
     mobile devices.

* [2020-01-14 Tue]

** Added
   - Notify on changes for changelog
     - This is done with a similar UX than other productivity apps
       (like Slack) do it. The user will see a 'gift' icon whenever
       there's a change to the changelog she has not seen, yet.

* [2020-01-13 Mon]

** Added
   - "Show Org filename in Header" is configurable in settings and
     off by default
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/229][PR]] üôè

** Fixed
   - Show error message when using a capture template with a badly
     configured header path

* [2020-01-12 Sun]

** Added
   - Make HeaderBar sticky
     - Making undo/redo, file browser and help always available
       (before it was required to scroll all the way to the top)
   - Deselect headline by clicking into the title (or empty space) in
     the HeaderBar
   - Show Org filename in Header

** Fixed
   - *Major synchronization improvements*
     1. After undo/redo, synchronize Org file
     2. Debounce Sync
        1. When a user changes things quickly (which happens easily
           when having 'live sync' enabled and using undo/redo for
           example), multiple syncs ran in parallel. The back-ends
           will either get confused or fail with errors (429 too many
           write operations). In any case, likely the last written
           state would not have been the state of the Org file in
           organice.
     3. Safeguard against concurrent sync requests to the back-end
     4. In case of synchronization error, show the error to the user
        and retry synchronization
     5. Don't actually sync a whole Org file for an empty header.
        When the user adds some data and triggers
        UPDATE_HEADER_TITLE, then it makes sense to save it.

* [2020-01-11 Sat]

** Added
   - All HeaderActionItems are undoable and redoable

** Fixed
   - Parsing planning items followed by a a checkbox
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/222/files][PR]] üôè
* [2020-01-07 Tue]

** Added
   - *Refile*
     - When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to
       copy some of the entries into a different list, for example
       into a project.
   - Add button in HeaderActionBar to open property editor
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/195][PR]] üôè

** Changed
   - All HeaderActionDrawer actions have icons. The icons are
     documented in sample.org and have a mouseover title.

* [2020-01-04 Sat]

** Added
   - Ability to search headlines
     - It has the same syntax as the search field in the Task List
       feature

** Fixed
   - Sort order in Task List
     - Tasks were only ordered by their planning item dates. This
       implied that tasks that were long DONE would be shown first.
     - Now, tasks in the Task list are sorted by state and then date.
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/207][PR]] üôè


* [2020-01-02 Thu]

** Added
   - Place cursor after the TODO keyword when creating a new header

** Changes
   - Highlight cookies and cookie percentages according to Solarized
     color scheme

* [2020-01-01 Wed]

** Added
   - Support single- and double-quoted strings in the search filter
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/176][PR]] üôè
   - Trim whitespace for entered or updated headlines
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/schoettl][@schoettl]] for the [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/177][PR]] üôè

** Fixed
   - Capture templates in iOS 13.3 are positioned properly
     - iOS 13 introduced a styling regression when setting focus
       without user interaction. iOS 13.3 reverts to the way other
       browsers do it.

** Changed
   - Revert "Move HeaderActionDrawer before headline"
     - As per #188, the changes introduced in #100 didn't fare well
       with the community. Hence, as a first step to improve UX,
       we're reverting to the previous state.

* [2019-12-31 Tue]

** Added
   - *Searching of headlines/todos with a composable query language*

** Added
   - *WebDAV as a sync backend!*
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/TristanCacqueray][@TristanCacqueray]] for your [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/82][PR]]!

   - As a user, when I swipe a header, I want the icon to contrast
     the background, so that better see the action taken
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/ragone][@ragone]] for your [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/78][PR]]!

   - As a user, when I hover a clickable element, I want my cursor to

   - Do not throw an error when clearing a planning item
     - Thank you [[https://github.com/ragone][@ragone]] for your [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/81][PR]]!

* [2019-10-02 Wed]

** Fixed

- On iOS 13, fix the regression which made capture input fields hide
  under the keyboard
  - More information and screenshots in the ticket: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/46
  - Turns out this issue is non trivial to fix and requires specific
    rules for every size of iPhone. I tested against the Xs and 6s. If
    you have a different form factor and the capture template input
    screen looks off to you, please send me a screenshot of what it
    looks like and I'll add the dimensions for your form factor right
    away!

* [2019-09-28 Sat]

** Added

- Implemented a =redo= Button next to the =undo= button

* [2019-09-21 Sat]

** Fixed

- Parser bug which would interpret *bold* statements in the beginning
  of a line as a header.
- Parser bug which would delete newlines between headers and items

** Changed

- @MTrost [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/45][introduced]] a new testing library called [[https://testing-library.com/docs/intro][React Testing
  Library]] which greatly simplified writing interaction tests.

* [2019-09-19 Thu]

** Changed

- Constraining to a max width and centering for tablets and bigger

* [2019-09-15 Sun]

** Fixed

- The 'Sync on application becoming visible' feature works on iOS and
  Safari
  - If enabled, the current org file is pulled from the sync backend
    when the browser tab becomes visible. This prevents you from
    having a stale file before starting to make changes to it.

* [2019-09-08 Sun]
** Added

- Documented how to use organice from a bookmarklet using the capture
  template feature

* [2019-09-06 Fri]
** Fixed

- Removed Google Analytics tracking, because it has no place here

* [2019-09-02 Mon]

** Added

- Configure Google Drive for the free community version of organice at
  https://organice.200ok.ch
- Documented SPA routing for self-hosting
- Wrote and publicized a Privacy Policy

* [2019-08-27 Tue]

** Changed

- Color scheme has been ported to the popular [[https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/][Solarized]] (light mode)
  - Whilst doing so, CSS variables have been introduced, so that
    there's not a whole lot of repetition of magic rgb values going on
  - The logo has been adapted, too
- The landing page and settings screens have been de-cluttered

* [2019-08-26 Mon]

** Added

- Continuous deployment: Merging to =master= triggers a build on CI
  and when successful, it triggers a deploy to https://org.200ok.ch
- Add a new temporary‚Ñ¢ logo: [[file:public/organice.png][organice.png]]

* [2019-08-25 Sun]

** Added

- Since we want organice to be a community driven project, we have added:
  - [[file:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.org][Code of conduct]]
  - [[file:CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing guidelines]]

- Add [[https://circleci.com/][CircleCI]] to run the tests on every commit
  - They are also integrated as a check for PRs with the benefit that
    contributors get automated feedback by running the regression test
    suite.

- Add [[https://greenkeeper.io][Greenkeeper]] for automated dependency management

- Add [[https://codeclimate.com][Codeclimate]] for automated maintainability analysis

** Changed

- Upgraded to Node 12.9

* [2019-08-12 Mon]

** Changed

- The default keybindings (when used from a desktop browser) are now
  more in line with the defaults in Emacs itself

** Fixed

- The keybindings work on non-macOS operating systems

* [2019-08-10 Sat]

** Added

- As a user, when in a directory listing, I want the folders and files
  to be sorted alphabetically. Furthermore, I only want to see files
  that organice can open (that is org and org archive files).
- Note: This is only implemented for the Dropbox back-end at this time.

** Changed

- Filters files from a directory listing down to org files.
- Sorts folders atop of files.
- Sorts both folders and files alphabetically.


* [2019-08-05 Mon]

** Added

- When the browser tab becomes visible, pull the latest version of the
  Org file
  - This is rather helpful when the app is used in production. Since
    the production build supports loading the complete application and
    org-file from cache, it can be open for a very long time. When the
    org-file hasn't been pulled in a "very long time"‚Ñ¢, then chances
    are non-nil that the file has been changed by another client in
    the meantime.
  - Without this change, when the user opens the app after a while,
    makes changes to the file and wants to sync to the back-end, there
    might be the message "Since you last pulled, a newer version of
    the file has been pushed to the server.". Now the user has two
    conflicting versions of the same file and can only chose to keep
    one (Which in itself is great UX and great error handling for
    cases in which we do encounter a merge conflict, of course!).
  - This situation is mitigated with this change. Now the user has the
    option to enable "Sync on application becoming visible" which acts
    similarly to "Live Sync". When the user opts to use this feature,
    whenever the application get's pulled from the background or
    started through the service worker, the first thing that happens
    it that a new version of the org-file is pulled from the server.
    It's therefore much harder for the user to create conflicts.

* [2019-08-04 Sun]

** Fixed

- Parser doesn't break indentation of existing files in fewer places
- Planning Items are formatted as in Emacs Org mode
- Properties are formatted as in Emacs Org mode
- Tags are formatted as in Emacs Org mode


* [2019-08-03 Sat]

** Added

- Documented deployment options
  - People have been asking for tighter access restrictions.
  - Imo the best answer to that request is to make it as easy as
    possible to host organice.
  - There's myriads of good options, of course. I picked to document
    two that will (potentially) be cost-free to the users and which
    are very easy and quick to set up: Ftp and Heroku.

** Fixed

- Tests on =master= were red
  - Partly due to obsolete tests
  - Partly because tests weren't updated according to changes in the code
