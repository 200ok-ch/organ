* org-web - org mode on the web
org-web lets you directly edit your org files online. It syncs with Dropbox and Google Drive and is optimized for mobile use.

It was born out of my desire to be able to easily view and edit my org files from my phone. It's available for use [[https://org-web.org][here]].

If you don't already keep your org files in Dropbox or Google Drive, I recommend symlinking them in:

#+BEGIN_SRC
ln -s ~/Documents/todo.org ~/Dropbox/todo.org
#+END_SRC

*Important note:* On July 31st, 2018 I did a force push to ~master~ with a complete rewrite. The current ~master~ branch shares no history with the previous one, which you should be aware of if you've cloned or forked!
** Development
org-web is built with React and Redux. It was bootstrapped with [[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app][Create React App]].

To install the necessary packages, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
yarn install
#+END_SRC

To run the app, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Getting the "Sample" and "Changelog" files to load requires this complicated looking command to set a couple environment variables appropriately (this is a hack until Create React App [[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3722][has nicer support for loading raw files]]). This is the command for the [[https://fishshell.com/][Fish shell]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC
env SAMPLE_FILE_CONTENTS=(python -c "import json; print(json.dumps(open('./sample.org', 'r').read()))") CHANGELOG_FILE_CONTENTS=(python -c "import json; print(json.dumps(open('./changelog.org', 'r').read()))") yarn start
#+END_SRC

And here it is for bash:

#+BEGIN_SRC
SAMPLE_FILE_CONTENTS=$(python -c "import json; print(json.dumps(open('./sample.org', 'r').read()))") CHANGELOG_FILE_CONTENTS=$(python -c "import json; print(json.dumps(open('./changelog.org', 'r').read()))") yarn start
#+END_SRC

To test against your actual Dropbox, you'll need to create a ~.env~ file by copying ~.env.sample~ to just ~.env~. To test against your Google Drive you'll need to generate an API key as described on [[https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js][this page]].

Note that this will only work if you're running the app on ~http://localhost:3000~.
